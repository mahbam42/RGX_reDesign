### _...for real this time_
https://moqups.com/#!/preview/Nkhqt51Y

#### notes on reading this design spec

* notes from Max are _italic_ and preceded by a - (dash)
* **Client's homework:** 

 1. Review the [mockup link](https://moqups.com/#!/preview/Nkhqt51Y) above
 2. Start drafting copy for internal pages 

     details are below

 3. Start selecting headshots for people page

## Style
Use [960.gs](http://960.gs)
* Main Content will be .grid_10
* main .nav will be positioned to clip the main content a bit and .grid_2 or .grid_3 in width with top corners rounded
* Page background will be [this texture](http://subtlepatterns.com/green-fibers/) with a dark green gradient at the top (using opcaity to fade into the texture)
* Textures and colors **TBD**

### Main Content
* large image on the home page (stock photo something business-y*) 
 _-maybe it will be a gallery down the road_
 
    .grid_9 across to leave some whitespage to the right.  

* three paragraphs of jargon 

    .grid_3 in width, try to match the height on each. 
    _-I'm thinking [this](http://subtlepatterns.com/vintage-speckles/) might work as a texture._
* Maybe some small stock icons 

#### Sidebar
* .grid_2 (maybe more)
* Social buttons(?)
* meaningless business jargon copy - about our offices (international), communications skills (something about redditing)

---
*there was one of a black guy standing at the bottom of a bunch of stairs going nowhere that could be fun

## Internal Pages

### About 

* ~250 words. History of the business (something like that)
* Graphics needed! 

### Our Team 

Something like [this](http://flip.hr/#crew) (flip.hr, weird cool designers) styled to match this site. 

_We might mix it up and play with it a bit. Max will create a few versions for approval_

* pictures of the team
* brief bio/personal statements (150 words or less)

#### People
1. Richard 
2. Max 
3. ???
4. You

    I like the effect of the rage face placeholder for recruitment, but as a consulting service we'll recylce it and make it be **"You"** (our client), and the personal statement will be our "ideal client"

### Expertise

Grided boxes with fields of focus - maybe credentials restated here
_-definitely if they aren't stated on the people page._

## Billing Information and Contract 

This project is to be completed _pro bono_* by the developer, **Max Brother** (henceforth "Max") for the client, **Richard Gottlieb** (henceforth "client") starting on **January 4th, 2013**. Upon approval of the design spec by the client, Max will provide a timeline and Estimated Completion Date (ECD) to the client.  

*excluding expenses for Third Party resources 

#### Considerations 

* Hosting will be provided free of charge, client agrees to pay domain registration and renewal costs. 
* All code and design elements are the intellectual property of Max Brother, content and copy is the client's. 
* In order to provide accurate timeline and ECD the client agrees to approve all work in a timely manner and is limited to **two** revisions. Should the client exceed this, any previsously submitted timelines and ECDs will be voided pending reassesment.
